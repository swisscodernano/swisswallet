## Acknowledgments

SwissWallet is a fork of [Wasabi Wallet](https://github.com/WalletWasabi/WalletWasabi).

We built SwissWallet on the excellent foundation provided by the Wasabi Wallet developers,
with deep respect for their work. SwissWallet extends Wasabi's privacy features with
Swiss sovereignty principles: hardcoded Swiss coordinators, no auto-updates, and
Swiss jurisdiction protection.
