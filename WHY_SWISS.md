# Why SwissWallet? The Case for Swiss Digital Sovereignty

## üá®üá≠ Swiss Values, Swiss Control

SwissWallet is not just another Bitcoin wallet‚Äîit is a statement of **Swiss digital sovereignty**. We forked Wasabi Wallet because we believe that Swiss citizens deserve financial privacy tools that embody **Swiss values**: neutrality, independence, precision, and unwavering commitment to privacy.

## The Swiss Imperative: Five Pillars of Sovereignty

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Neutrality (Neutralit√§t / Neutralit√© / Neutralit√†)**

Switzerland has maintained armed neutrality for over 500 years. This is not passivity‚Äîit is **active independence**. Just as Switzerland refuses to align with foreign military alliances, **SwissWallet refuses to depend on foreign coordinators**.

**Wasabi Wallet** routes your privacy through coordinators controlled by zkSNACKs Ltd, a **foreign entity**. Their servers, their rules, their surveillance risks.

**SwissWallet** uses **Swiss-controlled coordinators** on Swiss infrastructure. Your financial privacy is not subject to foreign jurisdiction, foreign data laws, or foreign political pressure.

> *"Switzerland's strength lies in its independence. SwissWallet extends this principle to your Bitcoin."*

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Privacy as a Constitutional Right (Datenschutz)**

The Swiss Federal Constitution (Article 13) guarantees the **right to privacy** (*Recht auf Privatsph√§re*). Switzerland pioneered banking secrecy laws in 1934, not for criminals, but to protect **individual liberty** from authoritarian regimes.

**Bitcoin privacy is the digital continuation of Swiss banking tradition.**

- **Wasabi**: Relies on foreign infrastructure where privacy laws may not align with Swiss standards
- **SwissWallet**: Hardcoded Swiss coordinators ensure your CoinJoin transactions are processed under **Swiss privacy protection**

Swiss citizens do not need permission from foreign entities to exercise their constitutional right to privacy. SwissWallet makes this a technical reality.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Precision and Reliability (Pr√§zision und Zuverl√§ssigkeit)**

Swiss engineering is synonymous with **precision**. From watches to trains to cryptography, Switzerland builds systems that **work exactly as intended, every time**.

**SwissWallet's approach:**
- **No auto-updates from foreign servers** ‚Äî You control when and what updates are installed
- **Hardcoded coordinators** ‚Äî No accidental misconfigurations, no trust in user settings
- **Deterministic builds** ‚Äî Verify that the code you see is the code you run
- **Tor-first architecture** ‚Äî Privacy by default, not as an option

Wasabi Wallet allows users to configure external coordinators, creating **attack vectors** through misconfiguration. SwissWallet follows the Swiss tradition: **one correct way, executed flawlessly**.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Direct Democracy and Transparency (Transparenz)**

Switzerland's **direct democracy** ensures citizens have final say over their governance. SwissWallet embraces this through **radical transparency**:

- **Open-source code** ‚Äî Every line is auditable
- **No telemetry, no tracking** ‚Äî Your usage data stays on your device
- **Public coordinator infrastructure** ‚Äî Swiss users can verify where their data flows
- **GitHub-based releases** ‚Äî No centralized update servers

You don't need to trust SwissWallet developers. You can **verify** everything. This is the Swiss way.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Economic Sovereignty (Wirtschaftliche Souver√§nit√§t)**

Switzerland's economic strength comes from **independence**: the Swiss Franc, gold reserves, and refusal to join the EU monetary union. Bitcoin represents the next evolution of economic sovereignty‚Äî**sound money independent of central banks**.

**SwissWallet exists to protect this sovereignty:**

- Your Bitcoin keys ‚Üí Your control (not custodians, not exchanges)
- Your privacy ‚Üí Swiss coordinators (not foreign surveillance infrastructure)
- Your decisions ‚Üí Manual updates, hardcoded security (not imposed changes)

When you use Wasabi Wallet with foreign coordinators, you **outsource your economic privacy** to entities that do not share Swiss values. SwissWallet keeps your economic sovereignty **on Swiss soil**.

## Why Forking Was Necessary

Wasabi Wallet is excellent software. We built SwissWallet on their foundation with **deep respect** for their work. But we forked for specific, critical reasons:

### ‚ùå **Problem 1: Coordinator Dependency**
Wasabi allows users to choose coordinators, including zkSNACKs Ltd's default foreign servers. This creates:
- **Surveillance risk** ‚Äî Foreign coordinators can log metadata
- **Jurisdiction risk** ‚Äî Foreign laws can compel data handover
- **Trust risk** ‚Äî You must trust foreign entities with your privacy

### ‚úÖ **Swiss Solution: Hardcoded Swiss Coordinators**
SwissWallet removes the choice. Privacy is **not negotiable**:
- Primary: Swiss Tor onion service (`.onion` hidden service)
- Fallback: Swiss HTTPS endpoint (`wasabi.swisscoordinator.app`)
- **No user configuration** ‚Äî Prevents misconfiguration attacks
- **Swiss jurisdiction** ‚Äî Protected by Swiss privacy laws

---

### ‚ùå **Problem 2: Auto-Update Trust Model**
Wasabi auto-downloads updates from centralized servers. In Switzerland, we know history:
- **1930s**: Banking secrecy protects refugees from Nazi asset seizures
- **1950s**: Swiss neutrality prevents Cold War data exploitation
- **2010s**: Swiss resist EU pressure to weaken privacy protections

**Centralized update systems** are vulnerability points. A compromised update server can push malicious code to thousands of users instantly.

### ‚úÖ **Swiss Solution: Manual, Verified Updates**
SwissWallet disables auto-updates:
- All releases via **GitHub** (transparent, auditable)
- Cryptographic signatures verify authenticity
- Users decide **when** to update (sovereignty over your system)
- Swiss tradition: **Trust, but verify** (*Vertrauen, aber √ºberpr√ºfen*)

---

### ‚ùå **Problem 3: Identity and Branding**
Wasabi's branding is global and neutral‚Äîwhich is fine for most users. But Swiss users need to know their privacy tools are **Swiss-built, Swiss-controlled, Swiss-values-aligned**.

### ‚úÖ **Swiss Solution: Clear Swiss Identity**
SwissWallet is **unambiguously Swiss**:
- Swiss flag icon (red + white cross)
- Swiss Red (#DC143C) UI theme (Pantone 485 C official)
- Swiss coordinators prominently displayed
- Name clearly identifies jurisdiction and values

When a Swiss citizen uses SwissWallet, they **know** their privacy is protected by Swiss infrastructure, Swiss laws, and Swiss principles.

---

## The Swiss Way: Control Without Compromise

Switzerland's success comes from **not compromising** on core principles:

- **Neutrality** ‚Äî We don't align with foreign tech giants
- **Privacy** ‚Äî We don't trust foreign coordinators
- **Precision** ‚Äî We don't allow misconfiguration
- **Sovereignty** ‚Äî We don't depend on external update servers
- **Transparency** ‚Äî We don't hide our code or infrastructure

**SwissWallet is Bitcoin privacy done the Swiss way.**

---

## For Swiss Citizens: Your Digital Sovereignty Matters

If you are Swiss, you understand:

- **Why we stayed out of the World Wars** ‚Äî Independence protects us
- **Why we kept the Franc** ‚Äî Monetary sovereignty protects our economy
- **Why we have banking privacy** ‚Äî Privacy is a right, not a privilege
- **Why we have militia, not standing army** ‚Äî Self-reliance over dependency

**SwissWallet extends these principles to Bitcoin:**

Your Bitcoin keys are your **digital gold reserve**.
Your privacy is your **digital banking secrecy**.
Your node is your **digital militia**.
**SwissWallet is your digital neutrality.**

---

## For Global Users: Why Swiss Matters

You don't need to be Swiss to benefit from Swiss values:

- **Swiss privacy laws** are among the strongest in the world
- **Swiss neutrality** means no political pressure to cooperate with foreign surveillance
- **Swiss infrastructure** is world-class (stable internet, strong data centers)
- **Swiss reputation** for precision and reliability is earned, not marketing

When you use SwissWallet, you benefit from **500 years of Swiss institutional experience** in protecting sovereignty, privacy, and independence.

## Technical Excellence Meets Swiss Values

SwissWallet is not just philosophy‚Äîit's **engineering**:

‚úÖ **Tor-first** ‚Äî Privacy by default, not opt-in
‚úÖ **Hardcoded coordinators** ‚Äî No misconfiguration attacks
‚úÖ **Independent data directory** ‚Äî Runs alongside Wasabi without conflicts
‚úÖ **No telemetry** ‚Äî Zero tracking, zero phone-home
‚úÖ **Manual updates** ‚Äî You control your software
‚úÖ **Reproducible builds** ‚Äî Verify the code matches the binary
‚úÖ **Swiss UI theme** ‚Äî Visual identity matches values

This is **Swiss precision applied to Bitcoin privacy**.

---

## The Alternative: Surrender Your Sovereignty

If you use Wasabi with default settings, you:
- Trust foreign coordinators with your transaction metadata
- Trust centralized update servers with your software integrity
- Accept that your privacy depends on foreign jurisdiction

**For Swiss citizens, this is unacceptable.**

Switzerland did not defend its independence for 500+ years to now **outsource digital privacy** to foreign entities.

---

## SwissWallet: Privacy with Swiss Precision

We forked Wasabi because **we can do better for Swiss values**:

- **Better privacy** ‚Äî Swiss coordinators under Swiss law
- **Better security** ‚Äî No auto-updates, manual verification
- **Better sovereignty** ‚Äî Your wallet, your rules, your infrastructure
- **Better identity** ‚Äî Clearly Swiss, clearly aligned with Swiss principles
