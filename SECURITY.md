## Security Principles

SwissWallet is built with **Swiss security standards**:

### üîí Hardcoded Swiss Coordinators
- Coordinators **cannot be changed** by users
- Prevents misconfiguration attacks
- Ensures all traffic routes through Swiss infrastructure

### üá®üá≠ Swiss Jurisdiction
- All infrastructure under Swiss privacy law
- Protected by Swiss Federal Constitution Article 13 (right to privacy)
- No foreign jurisdiction exposure

### üßÖ Tor-First Architecture
- Primary: Tor onion service (`.onion`)
- Fallback: HTTPS over Tor
- No IP address exposure to coordinators

### üõ°Ô∏è No Auto-Updates
- Manual updates only via GitHub releases
- Eliminates auto-update attack vectors
- Users control when to upgrade

### üîç Open Source & Reproducible
- All code publicly auditable
- Reproducible builds
- Community security review

### üö´ Zero Telemetry
- No tracking
- No phone-home functionality
- No data collection

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Wallet Security
- **Backup your seed phrase** - Write it on paper, store securely
- **Use strong passwords** - For wallet encryption
- **Verify downloads** - Check SHA-256 checksums and PGP signatures
- **Keep software updated** - Install security updates promptly

### Network Security
- **Use Tor** - SwissWallet uses Tor by default
- **Verify onion address** - `rhuvjl2kosdi3xgnmkr4bwnvpmlsvupajkubuazxendgtorvi2q4nhyd.onion`
- **Avoid public WiFi** - Use trusted networks when managing funds

### System Security
- **Keep OS updated** - Install security patches
- **Use antivirus** - On Windows systems
- **Full disk encryption** - Protect wallet data at rest
- **Secure your device** - Lock screen when unattended

### Privacy Best Practices
- **Use CoinJoin** - Enhance transaction privacy
- **Label addresses** - Track where funds come from
- **Avoid address reuse** - Use fresh addresses for each transaction
- **Run your own node** - Optional, for maximum sovereignty

## Known Security Considerations

### Bitcoin RPC (Optional Feature)
- **Disabled by default** - Must be manually enabled
- **Credentials required** - Set via environment variables only
- **Local node only** - Do not expose RPC to internet
- **See documentation** - [docs/build/BITCOIN_CORE_SETUP.md](docs/build/BITCOIN_CORE_SETUP.md)

### Tor Dependency
- SwissWallet bundles Tor daemon
- Tor connectivity required for Swiss coordinators
- Fallback to HTTPS if Tor fails (over Tor if possible)

### Data Directory
- Located at `~/.swisswallet/`
- Contains wallet files and configuration
- **Backup regularly**
- **Encrypt if possible**
